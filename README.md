- ✨ Hi, I’m Lisa Mac @hamstercat007 who completed an intensive software engineering bootcamp at the School of Code.
- 📂 My portfolio can be viewed on https://lisamac.netlify.app
- 💡 I’m interested in learning, improving, and creating applications which bring enjoyment when using them. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Express
- 🐈‍⬛ 🐾 I love being creative, and built a cat utopian world website where cats are active citizens of their world: https://purrcity.org/ as a creative project, whilst I was learning the basics of coding. 
- 💞️  I have volunteered and helped to organise workshops hosted at companies including Twitter, Google, Compare the Market, Innocent Smoothies etc for a coding group called Codebar - its aim is to help teach underrepresented groups into tech. 
- 📫 You can reach me on my email address: lisamac421@gmail.com
